				<h2>The Beginning</h2>

				<p>
				My interest in computers started when I was 11 when I realised I could use Scratch to create a simple clicker based game.
				</p>

				<p>
				This started to get me interested in computers and how they worked, however it wasn’t until I was 12 that I started to look at coding.
				</p>

				<p>
				My first interaction with programming was with Java, using the JetBrains IntelliJ IDE, and I followed a set of YouTube tutorials to start learning how to build small CLI based programs.
				</p>

				<p>
				After a while I became interested in GUI’s and it had me hooked: the ability to create the same interface modern apps use.
				</p>

				<p>
				Having Java as my first language, although not proficient in it, gave me the basic understanding of Object Orientated Programming from the beginning, and made learning languages like C# much much easier.
				</p>

			<img class="python-img" src="img/Python_Logo.png" alt="Python Logo">
			<p class="python">
			After Java, Python was the next language I learnt and helped me to apply the knowledge of how a programming language works into a new scenario. It opened doors for simpler code, use at school and easier debugging. For several years I worked solely on Python programs at home and at school, refining my ability to code using this second tool in my toolbox.
			</p>
		</div>

			<img class="css-img" src="img/CSS_3_Logo.png" alt="CSS Logo">
			<p class="html-css">
			With the prospect of new programming languages and Python’s Tkinter for simple GUI interfaces, HTML seemed to me like a shining light with its simplistic tags and easy to make interfaces, combined with a bit of CSS and I was turning out login pages like never before. I failed however, to realise the importance of Javascript and how it is an integral part to the triplet.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="php-img" src="img/PHP_Logo.png" alt="PHP Logo">
			<p class="php">
			I did a weeks work experience at a Web Dev company, and after that I became enamored with web based applications. I already had a free 3rd party hosted website, and by using PHP I added loads of functionality I never knew how to do previously. Cookies, sessions, tokens and data wrappers such as XML and JSON all became factors in my code, forcing me to find a solution using not just HTML and PHP, but also using AJAX and JQuery to communicate with MariaDB servers with user data. The whole concept of a frontend and backend was introduced to me and I learnt how to actually link the two together. The archive for this code is <a href="https://github.com/soapyL/original-website">here</a>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="cs-img" src="img/CS_Logo.png" alt="C# Logo">
			<p class="c#">
			I taught myself a fair amount of C# so I had a more common backend language to use. This knowledge was then expanded when I went to college a few years later, as we used C# as our primary language. I continue to use C# at college, however I don’t use it as much at home.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="js-img" src="img/JS_Logo.png" alt="JavaScript Logo">
			<p class="js">
			Finally, JavaScript caught up with me and I realised I had to start becoming familiar with it if I wanted to go on and do more complex projects. Unlike with C# where I spent a week forcing myself through all the W3Schools tutorials and Microsoft Documentation, it took me several months before I started to understand the principals behind JS and how to properly manage JSON between server and client.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="mysql-img" src="img/My_SQL_Logo.png" alt="MySQL Logo">
			<p class="mysql">
			With the introduction of JavaScript to my catalogue, I started to move away from the comfort of phpMyAdmin and start to set up my own databases and tables with my own scripts to automatically set and reset data when I needed to. By this point I had moved away from my 3rd party hosted site, as I didn’t have console access to run my own scripts and software, so I chose to move to a tiny Amazon AWS EC2 instance where I could conduct my experiments. This gave me so much more freedom to choose how to store my data, though I continued to use MariaDB as that is what I became familiar with.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="c-img" src="img/C_Logo.png" alt="C Logo">
			<p class="c">
			After wrapping up a large portion of my web based project, I decided to move more towards a low-level project, and I wanted to broaden my horizons and investigate how operating systems are built from the ground up. To do this, I learnt x86 assembly and a decent amount of C so that I could start writing an OS. This project is obviously a massive undertaking and is still ongoing, however I have details of current progress below. The low-level nature of C however has definitely given me a new found appreciation for kernel developers and the work that goes into it.

		<div class="block">
			<img class="nodejs-img" src="img/NodeJS_Logo.png" alt="NodeJS Logo">
			<p class="nodejs">
			When preparing to redesign my website, I figured a strong client-server connection would be the best option for security and reliability. This led to me discovering NodeJS which I used for my REST API. The breakdown of my design is further down, however Node was the first step into a clearly segregated backend and opened doors for the rest of the project.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="react-img" src="img/React_Logo.png" alt="React Logo">
			<p class="react">
			For the third rewrite of my website, I wanted to add more functionality than ever and in my mind that meant making my primarily desktop oriented website more accessible on small screens. React gave me the chance to create a smooth PWA with SSR designed for mobile first then desktop. The result of this iteration results in lightning quick load times and works seamlessly with Socket.IO.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="block">
			<img class="bootstrap-img" src="img/Bootstrap_Logo.png" alt="Bootstrap Logo">
			<p class="bootstrap">
			The use of Bootstrap 5, especially the React modified version of the Bootstrap framework allowed me in my final iteration to build an app much quicker as the prebuilt components are much easier to work with than bare CSS. Although it can be limiting, I view the use of Bootstrap as a tool to be expanded upon rather than the final design.

				<h2>My Development Environment</h2>

				<p>
				I use Arch Linux as my primary OS, with Wayland and Sway window manager. I love the simplicity of Sway and much prefer to use a handful of key binds for my apps rather than lots of complex menus. As a poweruser, almost all my work is done in the terminal, the exception comes for games, web browsing and GIMP for image editing. I believe using the terminal for most things is easier and puts you in full control of your computer, and allows for faster and more accurate productivity.
				</p>

				<p>
				For coding I mainly use Vim as Vi is too outdated and Nano is not suitable for proper coding. I will use Nano for small edits, and sometimes I will use the Kate text editor for certain programs where auto-completion is handy such as with HTML, however it is subject to the project.
				</p>

				<p>
				For production, I use a variety of tools, usually Ubuntu Server for my servers, and Raspberry Pi Lite OS for my Raspberry Pis. I then prefer Apache2 HTTP server over Nginx or other alternatives due to the ease of use and my familiarity with the reverse proxy setup.

		<h2>Project 1: The Website</h2>

		<p>
		The website has been my little project since about 2022, and has gone through three major iterations where a re-wrote the entire site.
		</p>

		<p>
		I won’t cover the previous iterations, however you can find the archived GitHub repo for the first edition <a href="https://github.com/soapyL/original-website">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		For my explanation of each step of the development, I will break it down into 5 parts:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Frontend</li>
			<li>The Styling</li>
			<li>The Backend</li>
			<li>The Websockets</li>
			<li>The Server Configuration</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		I unfortunately am not willing to expose the whole source code for the project as the project is still in development and will be for some time. It is an ongoing experiment and therefore does have bugs and security holes I wish to be left alone for now as I don’t have the time to QA test all my code as much as I would like. That said, I have provided snippets of interesting solutions I found along the way.

			<h2 class="header central">The Frontend</h2>

			<p class="central">
			The frontend design began with Figma, as I had learnt so much about how a website is made at my work experience week and I wanted to apply what I learnt to my project, and this started with UI/UX design.
			</p>

			<p class="central">
			The designer I spoke to gave me many valuable tips and many of those I now incorporate into even non web related projects such as PowerPoints for when I teach or posters for college.
			</p>

			<p class="central">
			Consistency is key.
			</p>

			<p class="central">
			This is why I opted for React. In my mind React made the most sense as it’s fast, versatile, modern, and easy to turn into a progressive web app later down the line. Because of that, almost all my design was built with an app in mind, forcing me to develop my ideas not for desktop but for mobile that expands to desktop: it’s about opening the market after all since over 60% of website connections are from a mobile phone. This meant the inclusion of hamburger menus, modals, off screen menus and minimalism helped to declutter the screen and simplify the user experience.
			</p>

			<p class="central">
			The use of React also allowed for easy implementation of a service worker for the PWA and therefore caching of files, making the app super snappy. I learnt about React components and hooks to create a set of pages which used a single router to funnel the user.

			The code above shows my simple routing mechanism that directs user based off their session validity which is managed by a React Context for continuity across pages, and by analysing the URL ending. This makes for a nice tidy URL and simple queries for navigation.
			</p>

			<h3>Google Maps API</h3>

			<p>
			There are currently 11 React scripts used to form the visual frontend, and in the Home component, I designed two features. An iframe to display content of an admin’s choice, and a Google Maps integration.
			</p>

			<p>
			The former is merely an updated version of my original system which used JSON to store and move the details of a video, and had to be changed in the actual JSON configuration itself, however this version can display content from any site, and is editable from a CMS built into the website for users of a high enough privilege.
			</p>

			<p>
			The latter uses Google Maps API to request the user’s location, feed that to Google Maps, return all McDonald’s within a 10km radius, selects the first one then displays the route on the map. It also features selectable driving and walking routes depending on the user’s preference. Although it works, the code is incredibly temperamental and often suffers after a harsh reload. It also takes several seconds to retrieve the user’s location which gives a perceived slow load time of the page when it is actually the fault of the device. I have tried to optimise it, however I find working with the Google Maps API incredibly frustrating and complex to use which often results in it just being half finished most of the time.
			</p>

			<p>
			Below is the code that retrieves the user’s location. This whole feature is done in React with no connection to the backend as there is no need, however I did keep having issues with previous loads sticking and being cached incorrectly, though that should be fixed now.

			<h3>Chat Client</h3>

			<p>
			The entire online messaging app is also incorporated into the main website itself, except the whole frontend takes up 518 lines of one single file. This app is designed to be a super quick light web based messaging service so users can access their contacts and chats on any device without having to download an app.
			</p>

			<p>
			This feature was less about the unique selling point or actually using it, but more focused on a proof of concept; a project that has a fairly high level of complexity at least at my current level, and requires me to use all my knowledge of the languages, networks, and the devices themselves to make.
			</p>

			<p>
			The current state of the chat client is almost finished, just small little finishing touches, however it took several months to achieve this. The chat client works in two parts: the frontend which manages the UI and handling sending the messages, and the backend on the server which manages receiving messages, forwarding them on to whom they are meant for, and sending the push notifications. The frontend is fairly simple, creating a secure websocket connection to the server so it can transfer data back and forth quickly, and keeps track of the contents of the text box, listens for incoming messages and updates the status indicator if the other user goes offline.
			</p>

			<p>
			In the side bar the client also has people they have messaged automatically saved to the sidebar so they dont have to search for the user again. This is where the database comes into play. Because the chat client is web based, messages aren’t saved to the device unlike most apps, instead they are kept on the central server where they are then retrieved. This could cause some security concerns, however each chat is assigned a unique table which separates other user’s conversations, and all messages are encrypted during transmission, and are stored securely in the database. This method allows for the same conversation to be loaded onto any computer without any trace of the messages left on the device.
			</p>

			<p>
			A major issue with this design is the scalability, and the massive servers and storage required to handle hundreds of thousand or millions of requests simultaneously, and this could cause bottle necks. A solution to this is instead of releasing the software as a competitor to other messaging apps, it could be made open source for the community to host themselves, with small scale groups using the network. This is how intend to release this software once I fully test and analyse my code.
			</p>

			<p>
			Below I have shown how the frontend sends messages, and how it renders messages as they come in. These particular parts were particularly difficult to get working, though it seems so simple in hindsight.

				<h2 class="header">The Styling</h2>

				<p>
				The first thing I wanted when I started the design was a sleek, modern, and responsive app.
				</p>

				<p>
				Bootstrap played a large role in my styling, as the predefined fonts, sizes and borders made it much easier to turn the web page into an attractive site with accessible features.
				</p>

				<p>
				The React Bootstrap framework also helped to speed up development as the prebuilt components allowed me to really simply set up modals and popovers without too much CSS code. Almost all the styling is done by bootstrap, which not only minimises the need for external stylesheets, but also allows me to import only the components I need for that page.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="code-div">
				<pre class="code">
<span class="red">import</span> { <span class="orange">Container</span>, <span class="orange">Button</span>, <span class="orange">Modal</span>, <span class="orange">Form</span>, <span class="orange">InputGroup</span>, <span class="orange">Table</span> } <span class="red">from</span> <span class="blue">'react-bootstrap'</span>;
				</pre>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>
				This doesn’t limit me however as I can still customise my CSS and use my own styling where I want.
				</p>

				<p>
				Below I have shown a screenshot of how I have used Bootstrap to create an offscreen menu that slides into view from a button, but used custom CSS to position the buttons on different screen sizes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-image">
				<img class="desktop-image" src="img/Menu_Example_Screenshot.png" alt="Exmaple Menu Screenshot">
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>
				One of the hardest parts of the styling was the splash page, as I wanted it to be visually impressive, and something that made an immediate impact. I went through various iterations in Figma, and used plenty of inspiration from <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">www.awwwards.com</a> and finally decided upon a wavy SVG pattern that could toggle between light and dark modes. Although not perfect, it still works fairly well and took a lot of trial and error to line up the timings with the SVGs. You can view it at <a href="https://portfolio.finnsinger.co.uk">portfolio.finnsinger.co.uk</a> or view the screenshots below. As it was designed mobile first, it has good cross compatibility in it’s effect and how the content sits in the frame.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-image">
				<img class="mobile-image" src="img/Website_Light_Screenshot.png" alt="Mobile Splash Page Light Screenshot">
				<img class="mobile-image" src="img/Website_Dark_Screenshot.png" alt="Mobile Splash Page Dark Screenshot">
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>
				Because the details are SVGs, it of course means the background is scaleable across screen sizes without any loss in fidelity, making it perfect for this use. I am pretty happy with how this page turned out and I hope to use some of the CSS I made in this with other projects in the future.
				</p>

				<p>
				Finally, the chat client used various different styles to achieve different looks depending if it was being viewed on a mobile phone or desktop. On desktop I opted for a always-on sidebar which kept all the buttons accessible to the user. I also chose to separate messages to either side of the screen, however I am still unsure about this decision.
				</p>

			<div class="flex-image">
				<img class="desktop-image" src="img/Desktop_Example_Chat_Screenshot.png" alt="Desktop Example Chat Screenshot">

			<div>
				<p>
				You can see how this drastically contrasts the mobile version which uses the offscreen menu to tidy the interface, while retaining the user experience.

		<div class="central">
			<h2 class="header">The Backend</h2>

			<p>
			The backend consists pretty much of one 1073 line NodeJS file that does everything from managing the database, to handling API requests and websocket handling. I will cover websockets later, however in this section I shall look further into the structure of the API and how it communicates with the frontend.
			</p>

			<p>
			The central file is distributed logically, which makes it easier to find specific functions in it. It looks something like this:
			</p>
		</div>

			</pre>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
			The breakdown of the backend into separate components within the same script allows for quicker response times without having to to worry about formatting data between servers; it just all stays as JSON. This makes it perfect for the small scale self-hosted use case mentioned earlier.
			</p>

			<h3>Imported Libraries</h3>

			<p>
			In terms of libraries I use, I have several.
			</p>

			<p>
			Express and http for setting up the http server and handling connections; makes it easy to build the API from the built-in endpoint handling.
			</p>

			<p>
			Redis for session handling and keeping track of session variables. I found Redis to be more reliable and more feature rich than express-session so that is what I use.
			</p>

			<p>
			The MariaDB node library makes connecting to the database super simple and allows for steady and secure connections with minimal latency.
			</p>

			<p>
			Helmet for request limiting makes it super simple to restrict potential DDoS attacks with simple IP based limiting. It also implements a security policy by default to prevent XSS attacks.
			</p>

			<p>
			fs and multer are also both used to manage files stored on the server such as user icons and other media which can be uploaded.
			</p>

			<p>
			web-push and nodemailer are both integral to the PWA implementation, as nodemailer allows me to send emails to clients for verification, newsletters and other contact, while web-push works well with IOS devices to send push notifications from the server. These are mainly used for the chat client but could easily be implemented in other ways.
			</p>

			<p>
			Finally, Socket.IO for real time messaging and websocket handling. I am very much still learning the ins and outs of socket but I am steadily getting there.
			</p>

			<h3>Accounts</h3>

			<p>
			In terms of how the accounts work, all accounts must be whitelisted, and can be added through the CMS panel. This updates the database table which stores all allowed emails that can register. The register page contains email, password, forename and surname fields which are kept separate so individual fields such as the surname can be updated in the settings page. Passwords are of course hashed and never decrypted, ensuring user security. Special caution is also taken to ensure the password hash never leaves the server as to not incur potential security risks. Each user also has an authorisation level which can be changed by an admin, and dictates what sections of the website they can access. This ties into the verification process which is started as soon as an email is registered. The backend will send an email to the registered email and will contain a link with a unique identifier which is passed to an API endpoint to verify the email does exist. This then updates the field in the table according to the user and allows them access.
			</p>

			<h3>API Endpoints</h3>

			<p>
			There are 30 API endpoints which are all used to modify content, check details and authentication, and update tables in the database. All endpoints that require authenticated users also use an internal function to check the user’s validity.
			</p>

			<p>
			Below is an example endpoint which is used to change a user’s profile image path. Notice the inclusion of ‘requireAuth’ in the defining statement. This calls the function below to check the session variables. Many of the endpoints follow a similar structure of check auth → update database → return status. The actual function that modifies the image and saves it to the correct folder in this example is called in ‘upload.<span class="purple">single</span>(<span class="blue">‘profileImage’</span>)’.This endpoint merely saves where the image if saved to. This frees up the thread to handle another request if needed.

		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
			In the chat client, when a user sends a message, two network calls are made: one to the socket server and one to the API. The API one handles copying the message into the database with who sent the message, who to, what the message was, and a timestamp. This simple approach keeps the code simple and reduces the need for the websocket server to communicate with the database.
			</p>

			<p>
			The database itself contains several standard tables for users and the associated data, the details for service workers when a user allows notification subscriptions, and tables for each conversation that is had between clients. This may seem like it could cause latency when retrieving or updating data, however the asynchronous nature of the database calls allow for rapid queries from the same device or network. To keep database sizes manageable, pictures or other forms of media except text and emojis are not permitted as it requires more bandwidth and space, potentially causing issues on slow networks. I do however plan to revisit this and see if I can get it to work with pictures.

				The websockets were fairly difficult to get working as they struggled to get through the Apache2 reverse proxy, and it took some specific configuration to allow it through. Although not particularly advanced, this code took me a while to understand and I spent a good few hours crawling through the Socket.IO documentation trying to understand what is achievable and how to do it.

				Below is the code I wrote which receives a message, and sends it to whom it is intended for, and checks for online users.

		<div class="central">
			<h2 class="header">The Server Configuration</h2>

			<p>
			The server configuration is very simple, just an Apache2 reverse proxy combined with the SSL key management.
			</p>

			<p>
			The Apache server catches all requests, then depending on the URL will determine which server to send it to. For example a request to /api/foo will be sent to the NodeJS backend on one port, while websocket requests get upgraded to secure websockets and passed to the server on the frontend port which serves the static pages after the React build. All other HTTP requests are pushed to the frontend to be serviced.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Server and Network Specifications</h3>

			<p>
			The website currently is being hosted locally, as I moved from an AWS EC2 instance to my Raspberry Pi 5 8GB, as the EC2 only had 1 vCPU and 1GB of RAM as part of the free tier. This meant I was having issues with the development server crashing and when installing large NPM packages. With the increased RAM in my Pi, I can now run multiple sites much quicker without fear of crashing. This does however bring the security risk of exposing my public IP, which isn’t great.
			</p>

			<p>
			To fix this I moved from Ionos as my domain name provider to Cloudflare, as that meant I could utilise their DNS Tunnel system which creates an outbound HTTPS connection from my server to Cloudflare servers, meaning none of my router ports need to be opened, and my IP is masked behind Cloudflare.
			</p>

			<p>
			The tunnel is hosted on my Pi as that has high uptime, however the tunnel is also configured to connect to my larger media server which I use as a NAS amongst other things. This means I can connect securely to all my services  through subdomains.
			</p>

			<h3>Apache Configuration</h3>

			<p>
			Because I copied my server configuration from the EC2 instance to the Pi, it needed a bit of tweaking, and is somewhat redundant considering Cloudflare acts as a reverse proxy as well, however it was easier to copy the pre-existing infrastructure than go through the pain again.
			</p>

			<p>
			It does mean Cloudflare manages my edge SSL, and so all connections inside my network between the Pi, my other servers, and the website frontend and backend are all plain HTTP, however considering most of my traffic is just my friends and I, I dont have much reason to make the internal connection secure when all external connections are already secure up to the Pi.
			</p>

			<p>
			Currently, this is how my website is processed (simplified but you still get the gist):

			<h2>Project 2: The Operating System</h2>

			<p>
			The OS project is an ongoing project and is more of an experiment than anything else. It allows me to delve more into the low level code that drives all our systems, and learn how to make that myself.
			</p>

			<p>
			I have found coding the OS very challenging, perhaps my most challenging yet, and I find myself drifting away from it for periods of time, but it is certainly an interesting project to have.
			</p>

			<p>
			I have built everything from the ground up, including the bootloader, file system and FAT drivers as well as having to code my own C functions.
			</p>

			<p>
			I haven’t got too far at the moment, only being able to boot from a floppy disk since it has a simple structure, and then having a printf statement print some text to the console, but that itself is rewarding to me and I am looking forward to getting my FAT drivers working.
			</p>

			<p>
			The OS is targeted towards 32-bit machines, however I am still currently in 16-bit real mode but I’m working on it.
			</p>

			<h3>Development Tools</h3>

			<p>
			I use qemu as my virtual machine to test, with bochs to debug and view memory contents while it is running. For my assembler I am using NASM as it was the first thing I learnt to compile ASM with and works well for me. I then use GCC for C compilation and Watcom 16 bit C compiler for code that needs to be compiled differently.
			</p>

			<p>
			A notable piece of code was a fix to Watcom compiler issue where it was giving me an error when compiling because it couldn’t compile a division function into 16 bit code, as the division was overflowing. I therefore had to write a custom assembly fix to perform this division for me. The code below shows how I did this:

			Alongside this I have learnt how to use CircuitPython to write a program that listens for button presses on a Raspberry Pi Pico, then sends it to the computer as a keyboard press. This could be used as a custom keyboard controller, or even as a hot switch panel to execute scripts with specific keybinds.

			This works well, however I wanted to also be able to have a toggle switch that would remain in a state until changed. This is example of how a kill switch for a machine could work.

			Recently I have also been exploring opportunities in robotics and have been using my A-Level Maths mechanics knowledge to work out the forces applied to joints and therefore the motors needed to build a form of robot.
			</p>

			<p>
			Although I haven’t built anything yet, I have drawn out some diagrams on how I may be able to include springs into the ‘muscles’ to aid in the relief of servos. This project will hopefully be able to bridge my knowledge of electronics with my software engineering knowledge and applied mechanics in the form of rotational forces and inverse kinematics.

					<p>
					I have used GitHub for years to store backups of my code as I work across many different devices, platforms and operating systems and GitHub allows me to have a central point for my code.
					</p>

					<p>
					I have experience using the GitHub CLI as well, as that is where I do most of my work, I am very familiar with how to add, commit and merge repositories from the command line.
					</p>

					<p>
					This ties into my Linux knowledge which is ever expanding as I use Linux daily and always learn new things.

					<p>
					I have only recently started using Docker, mainly to deploy applications on my servers as it is much easier to maintain and update.
					</p>

					<p>
					I wish I could have containerised my website with Docker, however it is too complex and would not be worth the effort of moving it into a Docker image.
					</p>

					<p>
					Although still relatively new to Docker, I am continuing to learn and aim to containerise my own projects in the future

					I have good experience with AWS services, especially the EC2 instances and elastic volumes since I used those extensively during my time hosting with them.
					</p>

					<p>
					I have also used S3 buckets for mass storage, and CloudWatch for cost and usage monitoring.
					</p>

					<p>
					I feel this has given me a good insight into DevOps and CI/CD processes and skills which I can build upon later.

		I have many plans for future projects, however I definitely wish to learn Perl, which although not commonly used, the knowledge or regex and the text processing power Perl has is certainly enticing. Alongside this I wish to do more with robotics and continue updating my website with new features. I also aim to work more towards GUI based programs that aren’t web related, using C#, Java, Python and potentially C++.
